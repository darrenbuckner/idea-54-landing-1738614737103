            <h2>Executive Overview</h2>
            <p>A platform that uses AI as a collaborative medium to enable groups to learn, think, and create together, unlocking new dimensions of collective creativity.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Traditional creativity and problem-solving approaches focus largely on individual efforts, missing the potential of harnessing the collective intelligence of groups. These methods lack tools that enable synchronized, collaborative ideation and creative exploration on a large scale.</p>
                <h3>Solution Statement</h3>
                <p>Introduce an AI-powered platform that facilitates group creativity through structured sessions like AI jam sessions, mind-melding exercises, and collaborative world-building, enabling groups to amplify their collective intelligence and achieve innovative outcomes.</p>

                <div>Score: 80</div>
                <p>The concept offers a unique value proposition by fostering &#x27;AI jam sessions&#x27;, &#x27;mind-melding&#x27;, and &#x27;collaborative world-building&#x27;—activities that go beyond standard brainstorming or collaboration platforms. Although there are existing collaboration tools, none specifically target these advanced forms of group creativity, providing a potential first-mover advantage.</p>
